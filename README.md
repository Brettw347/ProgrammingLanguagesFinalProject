## Overview
This project is a programming language that is designed to be used in the context of using Gen z slang.

## Demo Code
@ Prints 'Hello World'
yapper: "Hello World"..

@ Creates an int variable named 'number' with a value of 20
manifest number = 20..

@ Creates a static string variable named 'text' with a value of 'Bing Bong'
gatekeep yap text = "Bing Bong"..

@ Prints what is stored in the 'text' variable
yapper: text..

?? Creates a function called 'FactsOrCap' which is passed a number.
This function returns 'facts' if the number is greater than 10, 
but returns 'cap' if it is less than 10. ?? 
serve FactOrCap: num
    finesse: num >= 10
        clapback facts..
    throwhands
        clapback cap..

@ Calls the function passing 'number' to it
FactOrCap: number..

?? While loop that prints out numbers until number is greater than
30 ?? 
LetItCook: number < 30
    yapper: number..
    number++..

@ Creates a new string by type casting 'number' as a string
yap stringNumber = gaslight->string: number..
